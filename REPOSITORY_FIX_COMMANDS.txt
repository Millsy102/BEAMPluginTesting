REPOSITORY FIX COMMANDS
========================

The issue is that your DLL files are being tracked by Git LFS and exceeding your GitHub LFS budget.
I've already updated the .gitattributes file to stop tracking DLL files with LFS.

Now you need to run these commands in order:

1. First, untrack DLL files from LFS:
   git lfs untrack "*.dll"

2. Remove the DLL files from LFS tracking (but keep them in your working directory):
   git rm --cached "Plugins/BeamEyeTracker/ThirdParty/BeamSDK/bin/win64/*.dll"

3. Add the DLL files back to regular Git tracking:
   git add "Plugins/BeamEyeTracker/ThirdParty/BeamSDK/bin/win64/*.dll"

4. Amend your commit to use the same message as origin/main:
   git commit --amend -m "v1 testing repo setup"

5. Check the status:
   git status

6. Now you should be able to push:
   git push origin main

The key changes made:
- Updated .gitattributes to exclude DLL files from LFS tracking
- This prevents the "LFS budget exceeded" error
- Standardizes all commit messages to "v1 testing repo setup"

After running these commands, your repository should work normally without LFS budget issues.
